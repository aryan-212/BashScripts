## 2. PESU's Captive Portal

A Bash script that automates logging into PESU Wi-Fiâ€™s captive portal by sending a curl request with stored credentials. It checks internet connectivity first, detects the login page dynamically, and ensures seamless authentication without manual intervention. Ideal for automating daily campus logins.

## 3. Arch Auto-Hibernator

A Bash script that automates setting up hibernation on Arch Linux by detecting and configuring the necessary swap space, generating the appropriate kernel parameters, and applying all required settings. It guides the user through the process with prompts, ensuring a seamless and reliable hibernation setup.
